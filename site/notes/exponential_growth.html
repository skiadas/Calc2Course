<h2 id="exponential-growth-and-decay-1">Exponential Growth and Decay</h2>
<p>A number of physical phenomena can be described via growth and decay. The reason for that is simple.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the law that describes a physical quantity <span class="math">\(P(t)\)</span> over time is that <strong>the rate of change of the quantity is proportional to its current size</strong>, then that quantity is determined by an equation <span class="math">\[P&#39;(t) = k P(t)\]</span> whose solution necessarily has the form: <span class="math">\[P(t) = P_0 e^{kt}\]</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math">\(k &gt; 0\)</span> we have <strong>exponential growth</strong>, if <span class="math">\(k &lt; 0\)</span> we have <strong>exponential decay</strong> and usually write the equation using a positive <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, and as: <span class="math">\[P(t) = P_0 e^{-kt}\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quantity <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is measured in units inverse to the ones used for time.</p>
<p>As a quick example, suppose that we look at E-coli bacteria in a lab. Their growth constant is <span class="math">\(k=0.41\textrm{hours}^{-1}\)</span>. Suppose we have <span class="math">\(1000\)</span> bacteria present at the start. That is <span class="math">\(P_0=1000\)</span>. Then after one hour, we would have: <span class="math">\[P_0e^k = 1000\times e^{0.41} = 1507\]</span> bacteria. After 4 hours, it would be: <span class="math">\[P_0e^{4k} = 1000\times e^{1.64} = 5155\]</span> bacteria. And so on.</p>
<p>We can also ask for example when we will have say 20 times the number of bacteria, i.e. <span class="math">\(P(t) = 20000\)</span>. We then have an equation: <span class="math">\[1000e^{kt} = 20000\]</span> or <span class="math">\[e^{kt} = 20\]</span> or <span class="math">\[t = \frac{\ln(20)}{k} = \frac{2.9957}{0.41} = 7.3\]</span> so in about <span class="math">\(7.3\)</span> hours.</p>
<h3 id="doubling-time-half-time">Doubling-time Half-time</h3>
<p>An important quantity in exponential growth/decay problems is the half-time or doubling-time, namely the time it takes for the population to be cut in half (or to be doubled if we have growth). That quantity only depends on the decay/growth rate <span class="math">\(k\)</span>. That time is easy to find:</p>
<p>In order to have <span class="math">\(P(t) = 2 P_0\)</span> we must have <span class="math">\(e^{kt} = 2\)</span>, or: <span class="math">\[t = \frac{\ln(2)}{k}\]</span></p>
<p>Similarly for a exponential decay problem <span class="math">\(P(t) = P_0 e^{-kt}\)</span>. In order to have <span class="math">\(P(t) = \frac{1}{2} P_0\)</span> we must have <span class="math">\(e^{-kt} = \frac{1}{2}\)</span>, or the same <span class="math">\(t\)</span> as above.</p>
<p>In the example of the E-coli bacteria, doubling will occur after <span class="math">\(\frac{\ln(2)}{0.41} = 1.69\)</span> hours. And from there on the bacteria will double every two hours.</p>
<h3 id="carbon-dating">Carbon Dating</h3>
<p>Exponential decay is very useful in dating artifacts, via a technique called carbon dating. Every living organism contains carbon in two forms: <span class="math">\(C^{14}\)</span> is radioactive and decays over time, <span class="math">\(C^{12}\)</span> does not. Living organisms contains these two molecules in the same proportions, because they obtain them from the atmosphere. Once an organism dies, these carbon molecules are no longer updated from the atmosphere. Therefore if we measure the proportion of <span class="math">\(C^{14}\)</span> present compared to <span class="math">\(C^{12}\)</span>, we can estimate the time that has elapsed since the organism died.</p>
<p>In general, we have: <span class="math">\[\textrm{Ratio of }C^{14}\textrm{ to }C^{12} = R_\textrm{atm} e^{-kt}\]</span> where the decay constant is <span class="math">\(k = 0.000121\)</span> and <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is measured in years.</p>
<p>Let us do an example of this: Some cave paintings in Francy had a <span class="math">\(C^{14}\)</span>-to-<span class="math">\(C^{12}\)</span> ratio that was <span class="math">\(15\%\)</span> of that found in the atmosphere, $R_. Using the formula above we have: <span class="math">\[0.15 = e^{-kt}\]</span> or <span class="math">\(t = -\frac{\ln(0.15)}{k} = - \frac{-1.89712}{0.000121} = 15679\)</span>. So these paintings were created around <span class="math">\(16000\)</span> years ago.</p>

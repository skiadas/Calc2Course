<h2 id="improper-integrals-1">Improper Integrals</h2>
<p>There are two types of “improper integrals”:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrals where at least one of the endpoints is <span class="math inline">\(\pm\infty\)</span>.</li>
<li>Integrals that cross over a point where the integrand becomes infinite.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will consider both cases, starting with the case of infinite endpoints.</p>
<h3 id="improper-integrals-at-infinity">Improper Integrals at infinity</h3>
<p>So integrals in this category will fall into one of the following forms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math display">\[\int_a^\infty f(t) dt\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\int_{-\infty}^a f(t) dt\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t) dt\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea in each of these cases is simple: We interpret the integral as a limit of definite integrals with finite endpoints, as one of those endpoints goes to infinity. So:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math display">\[\int_a^\infty f(t)dt = \lim_{R\to\infty}\int_a^R f(t)dt\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\int_{-\infty}^a f(t)dt = \lim_{R\to -\infty}\int_R^a f(t)dt\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t) dt = \int_{-\infty}^0 f(t) dt + \int_0^\infty f(t) dt\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is perhaps the most elementary example: <span class="math display">\[\int_0^\infty e^{-x}dx\]</span> In order to compute it, we would first compute: <span class="math display">\[\int_0^R e^{-x}dx = \left.\left(-e^{-x}\right)\right|_0^R = 1-e^{-R}\]</span> We then take the limit as <span class="math inline">\(R\to\infty\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\int_0^\infty e^{-x}dx = \lim_{R\to\infty}\int_0^R e^{-x}dx = \lim_{R\to\infty}1-e^{-R} = 1-e^{-\infty} = 1\]</span></p>
<p>So in this case the limit exists and is a finite number. We then say that the integral <strong>converges</strong>. It is worth pondering that for a minute: The area represented by this integral spans all the way to infinity. Yet it is actually a finite amount, namely <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let us look at another example: <span class="math display">\[\int_0^\infty\frac{1}{x}dx = \lim_{R\to\infty}\int_1^R\frac{1}{x}dx = \lim_{R\to\infty}\ln R = \infty\]</span> So in this case we say that the integral <strong>diverges</strong>.</p>
<p>This last example generalizes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>p-integral at infinity</strong>. For <span class="math inline">\(a &gt; 0\)</span>, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\int_a^\infty \frac{1}{x^p}dx = \frac{a^{1-p}}{p-1}\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(p &gt; 1\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\int_a^\infty \frac{1}{x^p}dx\)</span> diverges if <span class="math inline">\(p &lt;= 1\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So the case of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{x}\)</span> is kind of an edge case: functions that are any “smaller” (<span class="math inline">\(p &gt; 1\)</span>) go to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> fast enough as <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> approaches infinity to have their integral converge, functions that are any like <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{x}\)</span> or “bigger” (<span class="math inline">\(p&lt;=1\)</span>) go to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> too slow and end up accumulating too much area, resulting in a divergent integral.</p>
<p>Exercise: Prove the above theorem.</p>
<p>Here is another general example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The integral <span class="math display">\[\int_0^\infty x^n e^{-x}dx\]</span> converges for all natural numbers <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, and equals <span class="math inline">\(n! = n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots 2\cdot 1\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us start with some base cases. <span class="math display">\[\int_0^\infty xe^{-x}dx = \lim_{R\to\infty}\int_0^R xe^{-x}dx\]</span> Now we do integration by parts: <span class="math display">\[\int_0^R xe^{-x}dx = \left.-xe^{-x}\right|_0^R + \int_0^Re^{-x}dx=-Re^{-R} + \int_0^Re^{-x}dx\]</span> Now taking limits as <span class="math inline">\(R\to\infty\)</span>, we have the integral we already did before, whose value is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, and also: <span class="math display">\[\lim_{R\to\infty}Re^{-R} = \lim_{R\to\infty}\frac{R}{e^R} = \lim_{R\to\infty}\frac{1}{e^R} = 0\]</span></p>
<p>Let’s consider the more general case: <span class="math display">\[\int_0^R x^ne^{-x} = -\left.(x^ne^{-x})\right|_0^R + \int_0^R nx^{n-1}e^{-x}dx = -R^ne^{-R} + n\int_0^R x^{n-1}e^{-x}dx\]</span></p>
<p>We now want to take limits at infinity on both sides of this equation. The key observation would be that: <span class="math display">\[\lim_{R\to\infty}\frac{R^n}{e^R} = 0\]</span> So we have in general: <span class="math display">\[\int_0^\infty x^ne^{-x}dx = n\int_0^\infty x^{n-1}e^{-x}dx\]</span> By using this formula repeatedly, we would end up with: <span class="math display">\[\int_0^\infty x^ne^{-x}dx = n(n-1)\cdots \cdot 2\cdot 1\]</span></p>
<p>There are a lot of interesting functions that can be defined as improper integrals. For instance the Gamma function:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gamma function <span class="math display">\[\Gamma(t) = \int_0^\infty x^{t - 1} e^{-x}dx\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This turns out to converge as long as <span class="math inline">\(t &gt; 0\)</span>, and we already have seen its value when <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is an integer. It is a differentiable function with a number of interesting properties, whose examination is likely mostly beyond the scope of this course.</p>
<h3 id="improper-integrals-at-finite-points">Improper Integrals at finite points</h3>
<p>Instead of having <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> go to infinity, we now consider cases where the value of the function goes to infinity, but at a finite point. There are many variations on this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Improper Integrals of the form: <span class="math display">\[\int_a^b f(x)dx\]</span> where we assume that <span class="math inline">\(a &lt; b\)</span> and:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\lim_{x\to b^-}f(x) = \pm\infty\)</span>, or</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\lim_{x\to a^+}f(x) = \pm\infty\)</span>, or</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> becomes infinity at some point inbetween <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>We approach such cases in similar vein as before: We integrate up to a point before the bad part, then take the limit. And for the third case we break the integral in two separate integrals belonging to the other two cases.</p>
<p>An example will make this clearer: <span class="math display">\[\int_0^1\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}dx\]</span></p>
<p>So in this case the function that we are trying to integrate becomes infinity at <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. We therefore would instead compute: <span class="math display">\[\int_b^1\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}dx\]</span> for some generic <span class="math inline">\(b&gt;0\)</span> that is close to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. We will then take the limit as <span class="math inline">\(b\to 0\)</span>. So effectively we say that we define: &gt; <span class="math display">\[\int_0^1\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}dx = \lim_{b\to 0^+}\int_b^1\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}dx\]</span></p>
<p>Let us now compute this integral: <span class="math display">\[\int_b^1\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}dx = \int_b^1 x^{-1/2}dx = \left. 2 x^{1/2}\right|_b^1 = 2\left(1 - b^{1/2}\right)\]</span> We now take the limit as <span class="math inline">\(b\to 0^+\)</span>, resulting in a limit of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. So we have: <span class="math display">\[\int_0^1\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}dx = 2\]</span></p>
<p>We can generalize this to various powers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>p-integral at infinity</strong>. For <span class="math inline">\(a &gt; 0\)</span>, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\int_0^a \frac{1}{x^p}dx = \frac{a^{1-p}}{1-p}\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 1\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\int_0^a \frac{1}{x^p}dx\)</span> diverges if <span class="math inline">\(p &gt;= 1\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Exercise: Show this!</p>
<h3 id="the-comparison-test-for-improper-integrals">The Comparison Test for Improper Integrals</h3>
<p>When dealing with improper integrals, some times explicitly computing the integral is not actually possible. In such cases, it is often worth it to simply know that it converges, i.e. so that there is in fact a number corresponding to it. The comparison test helps with that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Comparison Test for Improper Integrals</strong></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\geq g(x)\geq 0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(x \geq a\)</span>, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\int_a^\infty f(x)dx\)</span> converges, then <span class="math inline">\(\int_a^\infty g(x)dx\)</span> also converges.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\int_a^\infty g(x)dx\)</span> diverges, then <span class="math inline">\(\int_a^\infty f(x)dx\)</span> also diverges.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar results hold for improper integrals with infinite discontinuities at endpoints.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us look at an important example of this, which we discussed earlier as the Gamma function:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The integral <span class="math display">\[\int_0^\infty x^{t-1}e^{-x}dx\]</span> converges for all <span class="math inline">\(t &gt; 0\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This integral is interesting, among other reasons, because it actually exhibits both types of improper-ness: One of the endpoints is infinity, and the other endpoint may be a discontinuity of the function (as the <span class="math inline">\(x^{t-1}\)</span> might actually be a negative power if <span class="math inline">\(0 &lt; t &lt; 1\)</span>).</p>
<p>There are two very different cases to consider: If <span class="math inline">\(t\geq 1\)</span> and if <span class="math inline">\(0 &lt; t &lt; 1\)</span>. And in either case, we will want to further break our integral as the sum of two integrals: <span class="math display">\[\int_0^\infty x^{t-1}e^{-x}dx = \int_0^1 x^{t-1}e^{-x}dx + \int_1^\infty x^{t-1}e^{-x}dx\]</span></p>
<p>Now let us examine the case where <span class="math inline">\(t\geq 1\)</span>. Then the first integral is just a normal integral of a continuous function, so it is going to be some (unknown) number. But it is definitely going to converge.</p>
<p>The second integral requires more work: The idea is simple however. Let us pick a natural number <span class="math inline">\(n \geq t-1\)</span>. Then we have for <span class="math inline">\(x \geq 1\)</span> that: <span class="math display">\[0 \leq x^{t-1}e^{-x}\leq x^n e^{-x}\]</span> This is now set up perfectly for use of the comparison test. We know from our earlier work that when <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is an integer we can actually use integration by parts to directly compute: <span class="math display">\[\int_1^\infty x^n e^{-x}dx\]</span> and it converged to a number. Therefore, by the comparison theorem, we have that the integral: <span class="math display">\[\int_1^\infty x^{t-1} e^{-x}dx\]</span> also converges.</p>
<p>The reason we had to break this in two integrals is that the fact that <span class="math inline">\(x^{t-1}\leq x^n\)</span> only holds if <span class="math inline">\(x\geq 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now let us consider the case where <span class="math inline">\(0 &lt; t &lt; 1\)</span>. In this case <span class="math inline">\(t-1\)</span> is a negative power. We again look at the two integrals, now starting with: <span class="math display">\[\int_1^\infty x^{t-1} e^{-x}dx\]</span> Since that power is negative, we have that <span class="math inline">\(x^{t-1}\leq 1\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(x\geq 1\)</span>. So we can compare that integral with the integral: <span class="math display">\[\int_1^\infty e^{-x}dx\]</span> which we know converges. Then since <span class="math inline">\(x^{t-1}e^{-x}\leq e^{-x}\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(x\geq 1\)</span>, we have by the comparison test that the integral <span class="math inline">\(\int_1^\infty x^{t-1} e^{-x}dx\)</span> would also have to converge.</p>
<p>We are now left with showing that when <span class="math inline">\(0 &lt; t &lt; 1\)</span> then the integral <span class="math inline">\(\int_0^1 x^{t-1}e^{-x}dx\)</span> converges. We can do this by comparing it to the integral <span class="math inline">\(\int_0^1 x^{t-1}dx\)</span>, since when <span class="math inline">\(x\geq 0\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(e^{-x}\leq e^0 = 1\)</span>, and so <span class="math inline">\(x^{t-1}e^{-x}\leq x^{t-1}\)</span>. So our integral would converge if the integral <span class="math display">\[\int_0^1 x^{t-1}dx\]</span> converges. This integral has the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-integral form we discussed earlier, with <span class="math inline">\(p=1-t\)</span>. Those integrals converge when <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 1\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(1-t &lt; 1\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(t &gt; 0\)</span>. This is indeed the case.</p>

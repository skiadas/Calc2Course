<h2 id="area-between-graphs-1">Area between Graphs</h2>
<p>Suppose we have two functions, <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span>, and we want to compute the area between them.</p>
<p>If we follow our standard methodology for integrals, we could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Imagine cutting the x-interval up into tiny intervals.</li>
<li>For each of these intervals, the desired area can be approximated by a rectangle, whose height is the positive difference between the two functions, and whose width is the corresponding <span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span> width.</li>
<li>So mathematically that area is like <span class="math inline">\(\left|f(x) - g(x)\right|\Delta x\)</span>.</li>
<li>Adding all these together gives total area.</li>
<li>Taking the limit of this process gives us an integral.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The area between two curves <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> and the points <span class="math inline">\(x=a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x=b\)</span> is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\int_a^b \left|f(x) - g(x)\right| dx\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Write the integral that computes the area between the circle of unit radius centered at <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and the line <span class="math inline">\(y + x = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Write the integral that computes the area between the curves <span class="math inline">\(y=x^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y=1-x^2\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> axis.</p>
<h2 id="variations">Variations</h2>
<p>There are two variations that complicate matters. The first is that some times the curves under consideration are best described as functions of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> rather than <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Then the formula is essentially the same:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math display">\[\int_c^d \left|g(y) - h(y)\right| dy\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example: Compute the area of the region enclosed by the curves <span class="math inline">\(y^2 = x + 5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y^2 = 3 - x\)</span>.</p>
<p>Other times the area surrounded by the curves is more complex and you have to break the range up into pieces, then compute each piece via one of the aforementioned methods.</p>
<p>Example: Compute the area of the region enclosed by the curves <span class="math inline">\(x + y = 4\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x - y = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y + 3x = 4\)</span>.</p>

<h2 id="arc-length-1">Arc Length</h2>
<p>The methods of integration that we have seen so far can be used in the computation of the arc length of curves, as well as the surface area of surfaces. For now we focus on curves, and we want to somehow define the <strong>length</strong> of the curve <span class="math">\(y=f(x)\)</span> from <span class="math">\(x=a\)</span> to <span class="math">\(x=b\)</span>.</p>
<p>The idea is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Divide the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-interval from <span class="math">\(a\)</span> to <span class="math">\(b\)</span> into a partition, <span class="math">\(x_0=a &lt; x_1 &lt; x_2 &lt; \cdots &lt; x_N = b\)</span>.</li>
<li>In each interval from <span class="math">\(x_{i-1}\)</span> to <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span>, instead of using a rectangle to approximate an area, we use a straight line between the points <span class="math">\((x_{i-1}, y_{i-1} = f(x_{i-1}))\)</span> and <span class="math">\((x_i, y_i = f(x_i))\)</span> to approximate the function between those points.</li>
<li>To approximate the length of the segment of the curve between those two points, we use the length of the straight line between those two points, namely: <span class="math">\[\sqrt{(x_i - x_{i-1})^2 + (y_i - y_{i-1})^2}\]</span></li>
<li>The difference <span class="math">\(x_i-x_{i-1} = \Delta x\)</span> is the same quantity on each interval. The difference <span class="math">\(y_i - y_{i-1} = f(x_i)-f(x_{i-1})\)</span> can be estimated using the mean value theorem, as <span class="math">\[y_i - y_{i-1} = f(x_i)-f(x_{i-1}) = f&#39;(c_i)(x_i - x_{i-1}) = f&#39;(c_i)\Delta x\]</span> where <span class="math">\(c_i\)</span> is some unknown point between <span class="math">\(x_{i-1}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span>.</li>
<li>In that case the estimate of the length of the straight line becomes: <span class="math">\[\sqrt{(\Delta x)^2 + (f&#39;(c_i)\Delta x)^2} = \Delta x \sqrt{1 + f&#39;(c_i)^2}\]</span></li>
<li>We add all those estimates for each interval to obtain an estimate of the overall length: <span class="math">\[\sum_{i=1}^N \Delta x \sqrt{1 + f&#39;(c_i)^2}\]</span></li>
<li>We then imagine taking a limit at <span class="math">\(N\to\infty\)</span>. These sum expressions are exactly the <strong>Riemann sums</strong> of the integral: <span class="math">\[\int_a^b \sqrt{1+f&#39;(x)^2}dx\]</span></li>
</ul>
<p>It therefore makes sense to define the length thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <span class="math">\(f&#39;(x)\)</span> exists and is continuous on the interval <span class="math">\([a,b]\)</span>, then we define the <strong>length of the curve</strong> <span class="math">\(y=f(x)\)</span> from <span class="math">\(a\)</span> to <span class="math">\(b\)</span> is defined as: <span class="math">\[\int_a^b \sqrt{1+f&#39;(x)^2}dx\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a simple example, consider the circle of radius <span class="math">\(R\)</span> centered at <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, and its segment that is above the <span class="math">\(x\)</span> axis. This can be represented by the curve <span class="math">\(y=f(x)=\sqrt{R^2-x^2}\)</span> from <span class="math">\(x=-R\)</span> to <span class="math">\(x=R\)</span>. We start by computing <span class="math">\[f&#39;(x) = \frac{-x}{\sqrt{R^2-x^2}}\]</span> The length would then be given as the integral <span class="math">\[\int_{-R}^R \sqrt{1+f&#39;(x)^2}dx\]</span> Now we have: <span class="math">\[1+f&#39;(x)^2 = 1 + \frac{(-x)^2}{R^2-x^2} = \frac{R^2}{R^2-x^2}\]</span> So the integral becomes: <span class="math">\[\int_{-R}^R \frac{R}{\sqrt{R^2-x^2}}dx\]</span> This requires a trigonometric substitution <span class="math">\(x = R\sin u\)</span>: <span class="math">\[\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}\frac{R}{R\cos u} R\cos u du = R\pi\]</span> This is as expected: The whole perimeter of the circle is supposed to equal <span class="math">\(2\pi R\)</span>.</p>
<p>As an extension of the above example, suppose we wanted to compute the arc length as a function of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, starting from <span class="math">\(x=R\)</span>. Then we can think of that as the following function of <span class="math">\(a\)</span>: <span class="math">\[\int_a^R\sqrt{1+f&#39;(x)^2}dx\]</span> and with computations as above we would end up with the integral <span class="math">\[\int_{\sin^{-1}(a/R)}^{\pi/2}\frac{R}{R\cos u} R\cos u du = R\pi/2-R\sin^{-1}(a/R)= R\cos^{-1}(a/R)\]</span></p>
<p>In other words, we can think of the cosine as measuring the arc length on the circle starting from the <span class="math">\(x\)</span> axis.</p>
<h3 id="area-of-surfaces-of-revolution">Area of Surfaces of Revolution</h3>
<p>A similar approach provides us with a formula for the area of a surface of revolution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <span class="math">\(f(x)\geq 0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(f&#39;(x)\)</span> is defined and continuous on the interval <span class="math">\([a,b]\)</span>, then the area of the surface produced by the revolution of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> around the <span class="math">\(x\)</span> axis is given by: <span class="math">\[A = 2\pi\int_a^b f(x) \sqrt{1 + f&#39;(x)^2}dx\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Practice: Calculate the surface area of a sphere of radius <span class="math">\(R\)</span>. You should find it to be <span class="math">\(4\pi R^2\)</span>.</p>

<h2 id="numerical-integration-1">Numerical Integration</h2>
<p>There are numerous instances where the exact value of an integral cannot be determined, often simply because we have no way to find a closed form for the antiderivative. In such situations it is important, and convenient, to have methods for approximating the integral. We will look at various methods in this section.</p>
<p>First we need to set up some notation. All our methods are based around the idea of using a <strong>partition</strong> of the interval into <span class="math">\(N\)</span> equal pieces. We will fix our notation throughout:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\(\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{N}\)</span> is the interval width.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(x_0=a\)</span>, <span class="math">\(x_1=a+\Delta x\)</span>, <span class="math">\(x_2 = a + 2\Delta x\)</span>, , <span class="math">\(x_N = b\)</span>(<span class="math">\(= a + N \Delta x\)</span>) are the <span class="math">\(N+1\)</span> endpoints.</p>
<p>We also assign names to the values at those endpoints: <span class="math">\[y_i = f(x_i) = f(a + i\Delta x)\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="trapezoidal-rule">Trapezoidal Rule</h3>
<p>Our first method goes as follows: On each subinterval, we approximate the area by using a trapezoid connecting the endpoints. So in the <span class="math">\(i\)</span>’th interval, that goes from <span class="math">\(x_{i-1}\)</span> to <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span>, we form a trapezoid using the 4 points <span class="math">\((x_{i-1},0)\)</span>, <span class="math">\((x_i, 0)\)</span>, <span class="math">\((x_{i-1}, y_{i-1})\)</span>, <span class="math">\((x_i, y_i)\)</span>. The area of this trapezoid would be: <span class="math">\[\frac{1}{2}\Delta x (y_{i-1} + y_i)\]</span> Putting all these areas together leads us to the formula for the trapezoidal rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Trapezoidal Rule</strong>. The <span class="math">\(N\)</span>-th trapezoidal approximation to <span class="math">\(\int_a^b f(x) dx\)</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[T_N = \frac{1}{2}\Delta x \left(y_0 + 2y_1 + \cdots + 2y_{N-1} + y_N\right)\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also think of the trapezoidal rule as an average between the left-endpoint rectangles and the right-endpoint rectangles.</p>
<p>Let us try this in an example, using the integral: <span class="math">\[\int_0^1 \sqrt{1-x^2}dx\]</span> This is simply the area in the first quadrant under the unit circle, so it should equal <span class="math">\(\frac{\pi}{4}\)</span>. So we will use this method to try to approximate <span class="math">\(4\)</span>.</p>
<p>We need to first decide to break the interval <span class="math">\([0,1]\)</span> in smaller intervals. We will go with <span class="math">\(N=8\)</span>, so then the points <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(x_1\)</span>, are: <span class="math">\[0,\,0.125,\,0.25,\,0.375,\,0.5,\,0.625,\,0.75,\,0.875, 1\]</span> We start by computing the corresponding <span class="math">\(y\)</span> values, using <span class="math">\(y=f(x) = \sqrt{1-x^2}\)</span>: <span class="math">\[1,\,0.992,\,0.968,\,0.927,\,0.866,\,0.7806,\,0.6614,\,0.484,\,0\]</span> Now the trapezoid rule would say: <span class="math">\[T_8 = \frac{1}{2}\cdot 0.125 \left(1+ 2\times 0.992+ 2\times 0.968+ 2\times 0.927+ 2\times 0.866+ 2\times 0.7806+ 2\times 0.6614+ 2\times 0.484+ 0\right) = 0.772375\]</span> Multiplying by <span class="math">\(4\)</span> we get the following pretty bad approximation for <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span>: <span class="math">\(3.0895\)</span>.</p>
<p>But for using only <span class="math">\(8\)</span> intervals, it isn’t all that bad. One of the reasons that it is doing so poorly is the speed with which the function <span class="math">\(\sqrt{1-x^2}\)</span> descents to <span class="math">\(0\)</span> near <span class="math">\(x=1\)</span>. If you look at our <span class="math">\(y\)</span> values, they jump straight from <span class="math">\(0.484\)</span> to <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, and we are missing information about that transition.</p>
<p>Let us try another integral that also approximates <span class="math">\(\frac{\pi}{4}\)</span>, namely: <span class="math">\[\int_0^1\frac{1}{1+x^2}dx = \frac{\pi}{4}\]</span> We will use the same <span class="math">\(x\)</span> values as above. The corresponding <span class="math">\(y\)</span> values would be: <span class="math">\[1,\,0.9846,\,0.9412,\,0.8767,\,0.8,\,0.7191,\,0.64,\,0.5664,\,0.5\]</span> The trapezoid rule for this case would be: <span class="math">\[T_8 = \frac{1}{2}\cdot 0.125\left(1+2\times 0.9846+2\times 0.9412+2\times 0.8767+2\times 0.8+2\times 0.7191+2\times 0.64+2\times 0.5664+ 0.5\right) = 0.78475\]</span> Multiplying that by <span class="math">\(4\)</span> we find <span class="math">\(\pi\approx 3.139\)</span>. Not too bad!</p>
<h3 id="midpoint-approximation">Midpoint approximation</h3>
<p>The midpoint approximation uses the values at the midpoints of each interval. You can think of it as a “rectangle” approximation, or you can also think of it as a trapezoidal approximation where the trapezoid is formed by taking the tangent line at the midpoint.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Midpoint Rule</strong>. The <span class="math">\(N\)</span>th midpoint approximation for <span class="math">\(\int_a^b f(x)dx\)</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[M_N = \Delta x\left(f(c_1)+f(c_2)+\cdots + f(c_N)\right)\]</span> where <span class="math">\(c_i = \frac{1}{2}(x_{i-1} + x_i)\)</span> is the midpoint of the <span class="math">\(i\)</span>-th interval.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using the second example above, the midpoint <span class="math">\(c\)</span>s would be: <span class="math">\[0.0625,\,0.1875,\,0.3125,\,0.4375,\,0.5625,\,0.6875,\,0.8125,\,0.9375\]</span> The values of <span class="math">\(f(x) = \frac{1}{1+x^2}\)</span> at those points are: <span class="math">\[0.9961,\,0.966,\,0.911,\,0.8393,\,0.75964,\,0.679,\,0.6024,\,0.532\]</span> Then <span class="math">\(M_8\)</span> would equal: <span class="math">\[M_8 = 0.125\left(0.9961 + 0.966 + 0.911 + 0.8393 + 0.75964 + 0.679 + 0.6024 + 0.532\right) = 0.78568\]</span> Multiplying this by <span class="math">\(4\)</span> we find for <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span> the approximation <span class="math">\(\pi\approx 3.14272\)</span>.</p>
<p>Before we talk about error bounds, i.e. how can we tell how good the approximation is, let us see one final version:</p>
<h3 id="simpsons-rule">Simpson’s Rule</h3>
<p>Simpson’s Rule is a certain combination of the two previous methods, weighted appropriately. The final formula is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Simpson’s rule</strong>. For <span class="math">\(N\)</span> even, the <span class="math">\(N\)</span>-th approximation to <span class="math">\(\int_a^b f(x)dx\)</span> by Simpson’s rule is:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[S_N = \frac{1}{3}\Delta x\left(2y_0 + 4y_1 + 2y_2 + 4y_3 + \cdots + 2y_{N-2} + 4y_{N-1} + y_N \right)\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us try it out in our example, with <span class="math">\(N=8\)</span>: <span class="math">\[S_N = \frac{1}{3}0.125 \left(1+ 4\times 0.9846+ 2\times 0.9412+ 4\times 0.8767+ 2\times 0.8+ 4\times 0.7191+ 2\times 0.64+ 4\times 0.5664+ 0.5\right) = 0.7854\]</span> Multiplying by <span class="math">\(4\)</span> we get the approximation <span class="math">\(\pi\approx 3.14156\)</span>.</p>
<p>Not bad!</p>
<h3 id="error-bounds">Error bounds</h3>
<p>Will the above estimates are nice, and seemed to work not all that bad in practice, there is one piece missing: We would like to have guarantees about how close an approximation is. This is measured by the error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\[\textrm{Error}(T_N) = \left|\int_a^b f(x)dx - T_N\right|\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And similarly for other approximations. The error simply measures how far we are from the actual value. It is useful to have bounds for these errors, to be able to say for instance that “we are less than 0.005 away from the correct value”. This is the goal of error bound calculations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Error bounds</strong></p>
<p>If <span class="math">\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\)</span> exists and is continuous on <span class="math">\([a,b]\)</span>, and if <span class="math">\(K_2\)</span> is a bound on its absolute value, i.e. <span class="math">\(\left|f&#39;&#39;(x)\right|\leq K_2\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(x\in[a,b]\)</span>, then: <span class="math">\[\textrm{Error}(T_N) \leq\frac{K_2(b-a)^3}{12N^2}\]</span> and <span class="math">\[\textrm{Error}(M_N) \leq\frac{K_2(b-a)^3}{24N^2}\]</span></p>
<p>If the fourth derivative exists and is bounded by <span class="math">\(K_4\)</span> in absolute value, then: <span class="math">\[\textrm{Error}(S_N) \leq\frac{K_4(b-a)^5}{180N^4}\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us try these bounds in action. In our latest example <span class="math">\(a=0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b=1\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + x^2}\)</span>. We need its derivatives: <span class="math">\[f&#39;(x) = \frac{-2x}{\left(1+x^2\right)^2}\]</span> <span class="math">\[f&#39;&#39;(x) = \frac{6x^2-2}{\left(1+x^2\right)^3}\]</span> We need to find a good bound for this second derivative, on the interval <span class="math">\([0,1]\)</span>. The numerator is at most <span class="math">\(4\)</span>, whilc the denominator is at least <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, so the quotient is at most <span class="math">\(4\)</span>, so we can use <span class="math">\(K_2=4\)</span>. Then the above formulas read: <span class="math">\[\textrm{Error}(T_N) \leq\frac{4}{12 \cdot 8^2} = 0.0052\]</span> So <span class="math">\(T_N\)</span> would be guaranteed to be that close to the right answer. Similarly: <span class="math">\[\textrm{Error}(M_N) \leq\frac{4}{24 \cdot 8^2} = 0.0026\]</span></p>
<p>Recall that when we try to estimate <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span> with this method, we end up multiplying by <span class="math">\(4\)</span>, which would then multiply these bounds by <span class="math">\(4\)</span>.</p>
<p>The Simpson’s Rule estimate would require some more work. The fourth derivative turns out to be: <span class="math">\[f^{(4)}(x) = \frac{24\left(5x^4-10x^2+1\right)}{\left(x^2+1\right)^5}\]</span> It turns out that the best possible bound for this quantity is <span class="math">\(K_4=24*4 = 96\)</span>. The estimate for Simpson’s Rule would then read: <span class="math">\[\textrm{Error}(S_N) \leq\frac{96}{180\cdot 8^4} = 0.00013\]</span></p>
<p>That 4th power helps <span class="math">\(S_N\)</span> end up with a much smaller error, compared to the others.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: If we wanted to achieve an error less than <span class="math">\(10^{-12}\)</span> in this example, with Simpson’s Rule, how many intervals <span class="math">\(N\)</span> should we use?</p>

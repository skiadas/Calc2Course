<h2 id="compound-interest-1">Compound Interest</h2>
<p>In finance there is an interest concept called “compound interest”. The basic idea is simple:</p>
<p>You have a <em>principal</em>, your starting amount of money, <span class="math">\(P_0\)</span>. Then over time you accrue interest based on a fixed annual <em>rate</em> <span class="math">\(r\)</span>. So after a year the <em>balance</em> on the account would be: <span class="math">\[P_0 + P_0\times r = P_0(1+r)\]</span> Now what would happen if the interest is instead accrued every semester? This typically means that you also have an interest amount <span class="math">\(\frac{r}{2}\)</span> applied. After the first six months the balance would be: <span class="math">\[P_0\left(1+\frac{r}{2}\right)\]</span> For the next 6 months, the interest would be accrued on this increased balance, so at the end of the year we would have made: <span class="math">\[P_0\left(1+\frac{r}{2}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{2}\right) = P_0\left(1+\frac{r}{2}\right)^2\]</span></p>
<p>What if we accrue the interest more often, say <span class="math">\(M\)</span> times during the year? Then the formula, with very similar logic, becomes: <span class="math">\[P_0\left(1+\frac{r}{M}\right)^M\]</span></p>
<p>As <span class="math">\(M\)</span> gets larger, this quantity grows. That is not immediately clear, as even though the exponent increases, the base gets closer and closer to <span class="math">\(1\)</span>. There must be a certain balance between the two. In fact there is. Turns out that the following is true: <span class="math">\[e^r = \lim_{n\to +\infty}\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^n\]</span></p>
<p>This is what we do in the case of <strong>compound interest</strong>. We assume that the interest is accrued “continuously”, so as if the number <span class="math">\(M\)</span> of times in a year is very very large. In that case, we can work out the formula for the balance as <span class="math">\[P_0 e^{r}\]</span> and after time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> years: <span class="math">\[P(t) = P_0 e^{rt}\]</span></p>
<p>In other words, <em>continously compounded interest grows exponentially</em>.</p>
<h3 id="proof-of-formula-for-exponential">Proof of formula for exponential</h3>
<p>All this is based on the remarkable formula:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\[e^x = \lim_{n\to +\infty}\left(1+\frac{x}{n}\right)^n\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will now prove this formula. The first observation is that we can take logarithms on both sides, and then we can pass the logarithm through the limit (because it is a continuous function). Using the properties of logarithms, the equation becomes instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\[x = \lim_{n\to +\infty} n\ln\left(1 + \frac{x}{n}\right)\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will now demonstrate this formula, at least for <span class="math">\(x &gt; 0\)</span>. We will do so by figuring out bounds for <span class="math">\(\ln\left(1 + \frac{x}{n}\right)\)</span>. This follows from the fact that the logarithm is defined as an integral: <span class="math">\[\ln\left(1 + \frac{x}{n}\right) = \int_1^{1+\frac{x}{n}}\frac{1}{t}dt\]</span></p>
<p>We can get bounds for that integral by figuring out what the largest and smallest values of the function <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{x}\)</span> on that interval would be. This is easy since the function is decreasing. In our case, the smallest value is at <span class="math">\(1+\frac{x}{n}\)</span>, and it is equal to <span class="math">\(\frac{n}{n+x}\)</span>, and the largest value is at <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, and it is <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{1} = 1\)</span>. The general rule we will use is: <span class="math">\[m(b-a)\leq\int_a^bf(x)dx\leq M(b-a)\]</span> In our case this says: <span class="math">\[\left(1+\frac{x}{n} - 1\right)\times \frac{n}{n+x}\leq\ln\left(1 + \frac{x}{n}\right)\leq \left(1+\frac{x}{n} - 1\right)\times 1\]</span> We multiply by <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, as that is what interests us: <span class="math">\[x\frac{n}{n+x}\leq n\ln\left(1 + \frac{x}{n}\right)\leq x\]</span></p>
<p>As <span class="math">\(n\)</span> goes to infinity, the quantity on the left approaches <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, as does the one on the right. By the squeeze theorem, the quantity in the middle must also. And this is what we were trying to establish.</p>

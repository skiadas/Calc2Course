<h2 id="method-of-partial-fractions-1">Method of Partial Fractions</h2>
<p>The main goal of this section is to learn the techniques involved in computing integrals of the form: <span class="math display">\[\int\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}dx\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q(x)\)</span> are polynomials.</p>
<p>We will outline here the main ideas. There are plenty of examples in the book.</p>
<p>The method of computing such integrals follows 4 steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If the degree of <span class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span> is at least as much as the degree of <span class="math inline">\(Q(x)\)</span>, first do polynomial division.</li>
<li>Break the denominator <span class="math inline">\(Q(x)\)</span> into factors. We need linear factors <span class="math inline">\(x-a\)</span> as well as quadratic factors <span class="math inline">\(x^2+bx+c\)</span> where the quadratic has no real roots.</li>
<li>Perform partial fraction decomposition, where the quotient <span class="math inline">\(\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\)</span> breaks down into a sum of terms with denominators those factors from the previous step.</li>
<li>Compute the integrals of each of these smaller pieces.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will now look at each of these steps.</p>
<h3 id="polynomial-division">Polynomial Division</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Q(x)\)</span> are two polynomials, and the degree of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is equal to or more than the degree of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, then there are polynomials <span class="math inline">\(R(x)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(S(x)\)</span>, so that the degree of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is less than the degree of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> and so that: <span class="math display">\[P(x) = R(x)Q(x) + S(x)\]</span> or equivalently <span class="math display">\[\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = R(x) + \frac{S(x)}{Q(x)}\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quotients where the numerator has degree less than the denominator are often called <strong>proper</strong>.</p>
<p>To find <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> we use <strong>long division</strong>. An example would be: <span class="math display">\[\frac{x^3 + 1}{x^2-4} = x + \frac{4x+1}{x^2-4}\]</span></p>
<p>You can find many examples of long division online.</p>
<h3 id="factoring-out-the-denominator">Factoring out the denominator</h3>
<p>The fact that we can break down the denominator into a product of simple factors is an important theorem in algebra:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</strong> (for real polynomials)</p>
<p>Every non-constant polynomial can be written as a product of terms of two types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear terms <span class="math inline">\(x-a\)</span>.</li>
<li>Quadratic terms <span class="math inline">\(x^2+bx+c\)</span> with no real roots (irreducible).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>We will not prove this theorem here, but we will discuss how to find at least linear terms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The linear term <span class="math inline">\(x-a\)</span> will be a factor of the polynomial <span class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is a root of of the polynomial, i.e. if <span class="math inline">\(P(a) = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Roots can be found for instance via Newton’s method, or the bisection method, both usually seen in Calculus 1.</p>
<p>If the polynomial coefficients are all integers, then good candidates for roots are rational numbers of the form <span class="math inline">\(\pm\frac{p}{q}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> divides the constant coefficient and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> divides the leading coefficient.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once a linear term has been found, long division can simplify the original polynomial into <span class="math inline">\(P(x) = (x-a)P_1(x)\)</span>, then we continue with <span class="math inline">\(P_1(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>In most problems, we will be providing the factorization for you (or in the case of a quadratic, you can easily find it yourself by solving the quadratic).</p>
<h3 id="partial-fraction-decomposition">Partial Fraction Decomposition</h3>
<p>The heart of the matter is the partial fraction decomposition. At this point we have a quotient that has the form: <span class="math display">\[\frac{P(x)}{\left(x-a_1\right)^{k_1}\left(x-a_2\right)^{k_2}\cdots\left(x^2+b_1x+c_1\right)^{n_1}\left(x^2+b_2x+c_2\right)^{n_2}\cdots}\]</span> where the terms appearing in the denominator are distinct and have total degree adding up to more than the numerator. Then we can write this expression as a sum of terms: <span class="math display">\[\frac{A}{(x-a)^k}\]</span> and terms <span class="math display">\[\frac{Bx+C}{\left(x^2+bx+c\right)^k}\]</span> where the terms are amongst those that appear in the original denominator, and the power <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> goes from <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to the power appearing in the original denominator.</p>
<p>An example will make this clearer. Suppose we have the expression: <span class="math display">\[\frac{x+1}{(x-1)(x+2)}\]</span> Then we should be able to write it as: <span class="math display">\[\frac{x+1}{(x-1)(x+2)} = \frac{A_1}{x-1} + \frac{A_2}{x+2}\]</span> All that remains is to determine the coefficients <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span>. We do this by making common denominators, then equating the resulting numerators on the two sides: <span class="math display">\[x+1 = A_1(x+2) + A_2(x-1)\]</span> The key thing here is that this equality should hold <em>for all <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></em>. So we treat it as an identity: The two polynomials on the two sides must be equal. There are two ways to find the coefficients from here:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Equate same terms: The right-hand side can be rewritten as <span class="math inline">\((A_1+A_2)x + (2A_1 - A_2)\)</span>. So we must have that <span class="math inline">\(A_1+A_2=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(2A_1 - A_2 = 1\)</span>. We then solve this system of equations.</li>
<li>Plug in appropriate values for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. This can make things a lot easier. For example if we plug in <span class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span>, then the <span class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span> term goes away, and we are left with: <span class="math inline">\(1+1 = A_1(1+2)\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(A_1 = \frac{2}{3}\)</span>. Similarly, plugging in <span class="math inline">\(x=-2\)</span> makes the <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> term go away, and gives us <span class="math inline">\(A_2 = \frac{1}{3}\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>So we obtain: <span class="math display">\[\frac{x+1}{(x-1)(x+2)} = \frac{2/3}{x-1} + \frac{1/3}{x+2}\]</span></p>
<p>Some times we deal with one of the terms showing up with a higher power, for example: <span class="math display">\[\frac{2x+1}{(x-1)^2(x+2)}\]</span> In that case we need to include in the terms on the right the various powers as options: <span class="math display">\[\frac{2x+1}{(x-1)^2(x+2)} = \frac{A_1}{x-1} + \frac{A_2}{(x-1)^2} + \frac{A_3}{x+2}\]</span></p>
<p>To find out the three terms, we again make common denominators: <span class="math display">\[\frac{2x+1}{(x-1)^2(x+2)} = \frac{A_1(x-1)(x+2) + A_2 + A_3(x-1)^2}{x-1}\]</span> We now equate the numerators: <span class="math display">\[2x+1 = A_1(x-1)(x+2) + A_2 + A_3(x-1)^2\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>First off we can find <span class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span> by setting <span class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span> on both sides. Then we get <span class="math inline">\(A_2 = 3\)</span>.</li>
<li>Now we plug in <span class="math inline">\(x=-2\)</span>. This eliminates one of the terms on the right, and leads to: <span class="math inline">\(-3 = A_2 + A_3(-3) = 3 - 3A_3\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(A_3 = 2\)</span>.</li>
<li>Next, we can compare the quadratic terms. This leads us to conclude that <span class="math inline">\(A_1+A_3=0\)</span>, or that <span class="math inline">\(A_1 = -A_3 = -2\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So finally we have: <span class="math display">\[\frac{2x+1}{(x-1)^2(x+2)} = \frac{-2}{x-1} + \frac{3}{(x-1)^2} + \frac{2}{x+2}\]</span></p>
<h3 id="computing-the-resulting-integrals">Computing the resulting integrals</h3>
<p>All remaining integrals fall into one of two forms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math display">\[\int\frac{A}{(x-a)^k}dx\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(k=1\)</span>, this integral is simply a logarithm <span class="math inline">\(A\ln|x-a|\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(k &gt; 1\)</span>, we can integrate directly to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{A}{k+1}\frac{1}{(x-a)^{k+1}}\)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math display">\[\int\frac{Ax+B}{\left(ax^2+bx+c\right)^k}dx\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>where the quadratic has no real roots. These integrals can be solved by an appropriate trigonometric substitution using <span class="math inline">\(\tan t\)</span>, using the techniques we have examined in previous sections.</p>

<p>L’Hopital’s Rule is a powerful result that allows us to compute some difficult integrals that belong to the indeterminate forms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Indeterminate Forms</strong></p>
<p>The following expressions, thought of as expressions of functions that tend to those values, are <em>indeterminate</em>, meaning that their value depends on the particular situation:</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\frac{0}{0}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\frac{\pm\infty}{\pm\infty}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(0\cdot \infty\)</span>, <span class="math">\(1^{\pm\infty}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(0^0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\infty - \infty\)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, consider the silly expression <span class="math">\(\frac{2x}{x}\)</span>. If we take the limit of numerator and denominator, we get <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, yet the quotient goes to <span class="math">\(2\)</span>. If we had a different number than <span class="math">\(3\)</span> in the numerator, the answer would have been different. So the quotient of two functions that each go to <span class="math">\(0\)</span> really depends on more information, and could be any number depending on what the functions are.</p>
<p>Take a moment to intuitively think about why the other expressions can have similar problems.</p>
<p>In general, L’Hopital’s rule allows us to deal with such situations. Before we do so however, let us think of another approach to some of these limits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <span class="math">\(\frac{0}{0}\)</span> limit can often be thought of as a derivative, or a quotient of two derivatives, using the definition of a derivative as a limit:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x-a} = f&#39;(a)\]</span> and <span class="math">\[\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{g(x) - g(a)} = \lim_{x\to a}\frac{\displaystyle\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}}{\displaystyle\frac{g(x)-g(a)}{x-a}} = \frac{\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}}{\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a}\frac{g(x)-g(a)}{x-a}} = \frac{f&#39;(a)}{g&#39;(a)}\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For instance, consider the problem of finding <span class="math">\(\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{e^x-1}{x}\)</span>. This is a good example of a limit that looks just like the derivative of a function. In fact, if <span class="math">\(f(x) = e^x\)</span> then what we are looking at is: <span class="math">\[\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{f(x) - f(0)}{x-0}\]</span> So this limit must equal the derivative of the function <span class="math">\(e^x\)</span> at <span class="math">\(x=0\)</span>, which just so happens to be <span class="math">\(e^0=1\)</span>. So the limit would be <span class="math">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Another example would be the expression <span class="math">\(\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 1}\frac{\ln(x)}{x-1}\)</span>. Again what we are looking at is the very definition of the derivative of the function <span class="math">\(\ln(x)\)</span> at the point <span class="math">\(x=1\)</span>, which is <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{x}\)</span> at <span class="math">\(x=1\)</span>, or <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{1} = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s consider some quotients, like: <span class="math">\[\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\ln(1+2x)}{e^{3x} - 1}\]</span> We can divide both numerator and denominator by an <span class="math">\(x\)</span>: <span class="math">\[\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\displaystyle\frac{\ln(1+2x)}{x}}{\displaystyle\frac{e^{3x} - 1}{x}} = \frac{\lim_{x\to 0}\displaystyle\frac{\ln(1+2x)}{x}}{\lim_{x\to 0}\displaystyle\frac{e^{3x} - 1}{x}}\]</span> Now we see that at the numerator we have the derivative of the function <span class="math">\(f(x) = \ln(1+2x)\)</span> at the point <span class="math">\(x=0\)</span>. The value of that is <span class="math">\(\frac{2}{1+2\cdot 0} = 2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now on the denominator we have the derivative of the function <span class="math">\(g(x)=e^{3x}\)</span> at <span class="math">\(x=0\)</span>. That would be <span class="math">\(3e^{3\cdot 0} = 3\)</span>.</p>
<p>So the overall limit would be <span class="math">\(\frac{2}{3}\)</span>.</p>
<p>L’Hopital’s Rule does something somewhat similar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>L’Hopital’s Rule</strong></p>
<p>Suppose <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(g(x)\)</span> are functions defined around <span class="math">\(x=a\)</span>, and such that the limits: <span class="math">\[\lim_{x\to a} f(x)\textrm{ and }\lim_{x\to a} g(x)\]</span> exist and are either both <span class="math">\(0\)</span> or both <span class="math">\(\pm\infty\)</span>. And suppose further that the limit <span class="math">\[\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f&#39;(x)}{g&#39;(x)}\]</span> exists. Then we have: <span class="math">\[\lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x\to a}\frac{f&#39;(x)}{g&#39;(x)}\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is really important that you check the <em>hypotheses</em> of the theorem before trying to use its result.</p>
<p>Let’s employ the theorem in the example we just did: <span class="math">\[\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\ln(1+2x)}{e^{3x} - 1}\]</span> The individual limits of numerator and denominator are both <span class="math">\(0\)</span>. So we compute their derivatives: <span class="math">\[\frac{f&#39;(x)}{g&#39;(x)} = \frac{\frac{2}{1+2x}}{3e^{3x}}\]</span> Next we take the limit of this quotient, and if that exists it is our answer: <span class="math">\[\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\frac{2}{1+2x}}{3e^{3x}} = \frac{\frac{2}{1}}{3} = \frac{2}{3}\]</span></p>
<p>Some times we end up applying the rule twice in a row: The derivatives quotient may also be an indeterminate form, and we apply the theorem to <em>it</em>. Here’s an example: <span class="math">\[\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{e^x - x - 1}{x^2}\]</span></p>
<p>Both numerator and denominator go to <span class="math">\(0\)</span> as <span class="math">\(x\)</span> goes to <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, so this is set up for L’Hopital’s. We look at the quotient of the derivatives: <span class="math">\[\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{e^x-1-0}{2x}\]</span> Now <em>this</em> has both numerator and denominator go to <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, so we take <em>their</em> derivatives: <span class="math">\[\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{e^x}{2}\]</span> This limit can finally be computed, and it is equal to <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="other-indeterminate-forms">Other indeterminate forms</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Other indeterminate forms can be rewritten in the form of a quotient <span class="math">\(\frac{0}{0}\)</span> or <span class="math">\(\frac{\infty}{\infty}\)</span>, using one of the following: <span class="math">\[f(x)g(x) = \frac{f(x)}{1/g(x)}\]</span> <span class="math">\[f(x)^{g(x)} = e^{g(x)\ln(f(x))}\]</span> <span class="math">\[\frac{1}{f(x)} - \frac{1}{g(x)} = \frac{g(x) - f(x)}{f(x)g(x)}\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an example, let us take a look at: <span class="math">\[\lim_{x\to 0^+}x^x\]</span> This is an indeterminate form <span class="math">\(0^0\)</span>. We rewrite it: <span class="math">\[\lim_{x\to 0^+}e^{x\ln(x)} = e^{\lim_{x\to 0^+}x\ln(x)}\]</span> So now we are left with a different problem, that of the limit: <span class="math">\[\lim_{x\to 0^+}x\ln(x)\]</span> This is an indeterminate form <span class="math">\(0\times \infty\)</span>. We need to rewrite it, by bringing one of the terms to the denominator. We choose to bring <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, because it will be easier to differentiate <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{x}\)</span> than to differentiate <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{\ln(x)}\)</span>. So we have: <span class="math">\[\lim_{x\to 0^+}x\ln(x) = \lim_{x\to 0^+}\frac{\ln(x)}{\frac{1}{x}}\]</span> This is now a <span class="math">\(\frac{-\infty}{\infty}\)</span> form, and we try L’Hopital’s: <span class="math">\[\lim_{x\to 0^+} \frac{1/x}{-1/x^2} = \lim_{x\to 0^+} \frac{-x^2}{x} = 0\]</span> So <span class="math">\(\lim_{x\to 0^+}x\ln(x) = 0\)</span>, and hence our original limit becomes: <span class="math">\[\lim_{x\to 0^+}x^x = e^{\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 0^+}x\ln(x)} = e^0 = 1\]</span></p>

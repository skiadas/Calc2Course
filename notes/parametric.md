## Parametric Equations

This section will just refer to important parts of the text to focus on:

### 12.1

- Example 2 on eliminating the parameter
- Theorem 1 an example 4 on how to parametrize linear curves
- Parametrizing a circle, at top of page 616
- Example 5 on parametrizing an ellipse
- Example 6 on how the same curve can have different parametrizations
- Example 8 on the cycloid and its parametric equations
- Theorem 2 on the slope of the tangent line in parametric form

### 12.2

- Theorem 1 and the description up to that point
- Example 1 calculating the arc length of a circle in that way
- Example 2 calculating the length of the cycloid
